# Hybrid-Based-Machine-Learning-Models-in-Bank-Account-Ownership-Classification
## Statement of the Problem
In East Africa, the financial sector has made significant progress towards financial inclusion, encouraging individuals to embrace technological advancements in the financial sector like owning a bank account. However, most of the population in the region do not own bank accounts despite the efforts, but rather prefer the traditional means of managing their income. Determining the factors that contributes to an individual either owning a bank account or not is crucial, as this will enable the financial sector, specifically banks to craft certain solutions that could draw these individuals into the financial system, and thus be bank account holders. Single ML models incapably capture complex, nonlinear relationships among socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors influencing financial inclusion. They often overfit or underfit, perform poorly on imbalanced data, and fail to detect variable interactions, limiting their predictive power. There is a need to evaluate hybrid-based ML models that combine multiple algorithms to enhance accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in predicting bank account across East African countries.
## Objectives of Study
1. To determine key factors influencing individual bank account ownership.
2. To compare the predictive power of hybrid-based ML models to single ML models.
